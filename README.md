# gimp2.8-config
A customized Gimp 2.8 config folder to make it look more like Adobe Photoshop

To use this configuration overwrite the folder with the name .gimp you have in your /home directory with this ongge.

If you don't see any folder with that name you just need to open Gimp for the first time to get it created.
