# gimp2.8-config
A customized Gimp 2.8 config folder to make it look more like Adobe Photoshop

To use this configuration follow these steps:

1. Download and extract gimp-2.8.tar.gz.
2. Overwrite the folder with the name .gimp-2.8 you have in your /home directory with the one you have just extracted. If you don't see any folder with that name you just need to open Gimp for the first time to get it created.
